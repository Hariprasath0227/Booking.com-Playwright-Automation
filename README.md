# Swivel â€“ Booking.com Assessment (Playwright + TypeScript)

This project automates all **21 steps** of the Booking.com assessment using Playwright.  
It follows best practices with **Page Object Model (POM)**, **parametrized test data**, **multi-browser support**, and **CI/CD integration**.

This project automates all 21 steps of the Booking.com assessment using Playwright, with:
- Page Object Model
- Parametrized test data & `.env` configs
- Multi-browser support (Chromium/Firefox/WebKit)
- Allure reporting
- Logging via `pino`
- GitHub Actions CI

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (recommended Node 20)
- Git
- (Optional) Allure CLI: https://docs.qameta.io/allure/#_get_started

## âš¡ Setup & Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url> booking-automation
cd booking-automation

# Setup environment variables
cp .env.sample .env   # adjust values if needed

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install

# Prepare Husky & configs
npm run prepare


## Challenges Faced

1.Dynamic locators on Booking.com

2.Many elements (rooms, buttons) have dynamic IDs.

*Solution: Used getByRole, getByTestId, and filters like nth() to reliably locate elements.

1.Date picker complexity

2.Selecting check-in/out required JavaScript-based manipulation.

*Solution: Implemented selectDateJS() utility and used offsets from today.

1.Popup interruptions

2.Popups like Genius offers sometimes blocked interactions.

*Solution: Added a handleGeniusPopup utility to close popups if present.

1.Assertions for dynamic content

2.Hotel names, prices, and dates vary.

*Solution: Captured values dynamically, then asserted against expected/test data.

1.Logger integration

2.Needed clear console logs for each step.

*Solution: Integrated pino logger with logger.info() for key actions and verification.

1.Page Object Model structure

2.Separating actions (BookingPage) vs verifications (CheckoutPage) required careful planning.

*Solution: Modular POM design with reusable methods and assertions.

ðŸ“Œ Notes

Browser support: Chrome, Firefox, WebKit.

Reporting: Playwright HTML and console logs via logger.

Test execution: Modular; can run specific page flows independently.

Extensibility: Easily add more test scenarios by extending POM classes.
